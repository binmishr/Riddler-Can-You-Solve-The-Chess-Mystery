Summary
=============
The Riddler is a weekly puzzle provided by FiveThirtyEight. This week’s puzzle involves
finding the path used by the knight to kill the opposing queen in a game
of chess. Below, I show how I solved puzzle using two methods: a
siumulation of the chessboard and by building a graph of the possible
paths for the knight. The simulations were good, but not solution was
found in the first attempt. Only after realizing a key insight could the
riddle be solved.

    From Yan Zhang comes a royal murder mystery:

    Black Bishop: “Sir, forensic testing indicates the Queen’s assassin,
    the White Knight between us, has moved exactly eight times since the
    beginning of the game, which has been played by the legal rules.”

    Black King: “So?”

    Black Bishop: “Well, to convict this assassin, we need to construct a
    legal game history. But we just can’t figure out how he got there!”
